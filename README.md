# gpx

Cycling gpx tracks how to.

## Method  

1. Plot track on google maps.
2. Paste URL into http://www.gpsvisualizer.com/convert_input?convert_format=gpx
3. Save text as .gpx

## Notes

Garmin etrex vista has an approximate 10k waypoints per track so if limit is exceeded split .gpx file appropriately.  
Alternatively, in GPS Visualizer advanced options, set "Max. points per track:" to maximum allowed by device.
